# Create swap EIP 5792 calldata

`POST https://trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1/swap_5792`  
operationId: `create_swap_5792_transaction` · tags: swap-batching

Create the EIP 5792 calldata for a swap transaction (including wrap/unwrap and bridging) against the Uniswap Protocols. If the `quote` parameter includes the fee parameters, then the calldata will include the fee disbursement. The gas estimates will be **more precise** when the response calldata would be valid if submitted on-chain.

## Parameters

- `x-universal-router-version` (header): The version of the Universal Router to use for the swap journey. *MUST* be consistent throughout the API calls. default `2.0`

## Request body (application/json)

- `quote` (required): object
  - oneOf: `Classic Quote` object
    - `priceDifference`: number. The expected value lost versus frictionless execution at current prices, as a percent between -100 and 100. Negative values indicate price improvement. For classic swaps this equals priceImpact, the pool-based impact reported by routing
    - `input`: object
      - `amount`: string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
      - `token`: string. The token which will be sent, specified by its token address. For a list of supported tokens, see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)
      - `maximumAmount`: string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
    - `output`: object
      - `amount`: string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
      - `token`: string. The token which will be received, specified by its token address. For a list of supported tokens, see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)

      - `minimumAmount`: string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
    - `swapper`: string. The wallet address which will be used to send the token
    - `chainId`: number = `1`, `10`, `56`, `130`, `137`, `143`, `196`, `324`, `480`, `1868`, `4217`, `4326`, `4663`, `5042`, `8453`, `10143`, `42161`, `42220`, `43114`, `57073`, `59144`, `81457`, `7777777`, `1301`, `84532`, `11155111`.

    - `slippage`: number. The slippage tolerance as a percentage up to a maximum of two decimal places. For Uniswap Protocols (v2, v3, v4), the slippage tolerance is the maximum amount the price can change between the time the transaction is submitted and the time it is executed. The slippage tolerance is a percentage of the total value of the swap.  When submitting a quote, note that slippage tolerance works differently in UniswapX swaps where it does not set a limit on the Spread in an order. See [here](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs#why-do-uniswapx-quotes-have-more-slippage-than-the-tolerance-i-set) for more information.  Note that if the trade type is `EXACT_INPUT`, then the slippage is in terms of the output token. If the trade type is `EXACT_OUTPUT`, then the slippage is in terms of the input token.  When submitting a request, `slippageTolerance` may not be set when `autoSlippage` is defined. One of `slippageTolerance` or `autoSlippage` must be defined

    - `classicGasUseEstimateUSD`: string. The gas fee you would pay if you opted for a CLASSIC swap over a Uniswap X order in terms of USD
    - `expectedAmountIn`: string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
    - `expectedAmountOut`: string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
    - `aggregatedOutputs`: array
      - items:
        - `token`: string. The token which will be received, specified by its token address. For a list of supported tokens, see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)
        - `amount`: string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
        - `recipient`: string. (optional) The wallet address which will receive the output of the swap. If not provided, the output is returned to the `swapper`
        - `bps`: number. The portion of the swap stated in basis points. Fractional basis points are supported with up to two decimal places (e.g. 12.5)
        - `minAmount`: string. The minimum portion of the swap, stated in the base unit of the token, which will be output to the recipient
        - `fee`: string = `INTEGRATOR`. Set to INTEGRATOR when this output is an integrator fee (as specified by the `integratorFees` array in the /quote request); omitted for the core output of the swap
- `permitData`: object. the permit2 message object for the customer to sign to permit spending by the permit2 contract
  - `domain`: object
  - `values`: object
  - `types`: object
- `deadline`: number. The unix timestamp at which the order will be reverted if not filled
- `urgency`: object. The urgency impacts the estimated gas price of the transaction. The higher the urgency, the higher the gas price, and the faster the transaction is likely to be selected from the mempool. Send the bare string form (e.g. `"normal"`) for the common case, or the object form `{ level, overrides }` to supply caller caps for `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `maxFeePerGas`, and `gasLimit`

    - `overrides`: object. Caller-supplied caps applied on top of the gas service's computed quote. All fields are absolute wei (decimal string). `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas` are treated as caps - they lower the quote, never raise it. `gasLimit`, if set, replaces the limit calculation entirely
      - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: string. Maximum priority fee in wei (decimal string)
      - `maxFeePerGas`: string. Maximum total fee per gas in wei (decimal string)
      - `gasLimit`: string. Gas limit cap (in gas units, decimal string)
- `sponsorshipInfo`: object. Gas sponsorship information for the quoted swap. When `sponsored` is `true`, gas fees for executing this swap will be covered by the sponsor described in `sponsorMetadata`, under the campaign described in `campaign`. When `sponsored` is `false`, `rejectionReason` describes why sponsorship was not granted
  - `sponsored`: boolean. Whether gas for this swap is sponsored
  - `rejectionReason`: string. Reason gas sponsorship was not granted. Present only when `sponsored` is `false`
  - `campaign`: object. Display information about the sponsorship campaign covering gas fees for the swap

      - items:
        - `unit`: string = `FREE_SWAPS`, `USD_CENT`. Unit the allowance is denominated in
        - `total`: string. Total per-wallet allowance
        - `remaining`: string. Allowance still available to this wallet
    - `eligibleChains`: array. Chain IDs the campaign covers, for the eligible-chains modal

    - `name`: string. Display name of the sponsor
    - `icon`: string. URL of the sponsor's icon
- `approvalOnly`: boolean. Return only the ERC-20 approval call(s) for the quote's input token — no swap transaction. Required (and only supported) for UniswapX quotes, whose swap is an off-chain signed order

## Responses

### 200: Create 5792 swap successful.

- `requestId` (required): string. A unique ID for the request
- `from` (required): string
- `chainId` (required): number = `1`, `10`, `56`, `130`, `137`, `143`, `196`, `324`, `480`, `1868`, `4217`, `4326`, `4663`, `5042`, `8453`, `10143`, `42161`, `42220`, `43114`, `57073`, `59144`, `81457`, `7777777`, `1301`, `84532`, `11155111`. The unique ID of the blockchain. For a list of supported chains see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)
- `calls` (required): array
  - items:
    - `to` (required): string. (optional) The wallet address which will receive the output of the swap. If not provided, the output is returned to the `swapper`
    - `data` (required): string. The calldata for the transaction
    - `value` (required): string. The quantity of ETH tokens approved for spending by the transaction, denominated in wei. Note that by default Uniswap Labs sets this to the maximum approvable spend
    - `gasLimit`: string. The maximum units of gas that will be consumed by this transaction
    - `maxFeePerGas`: string. The sum of the base fee and priority fee. Subtracting `maxPriorityFeePerGas` from this value will yield the base fee to be paid for this transaction
    - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: string. The maximum tip to the block builder. Adjusted based upon the urgency specified in the request
    - `gasPrice`: string. The cost per unit of gas
- `gasFee`: string. The total estimated gas cost of this transaction (eg. `gasLimit` multiplied by `maxFeePerGas`) in the base unit of the chain
- `paymasterService`: object. EIP-7677 paymasterService capability. Present only when this swap is sponsored. The wallet forwards `context` as-is to the URL; the trading service does not expect the wallet to inspect or modify it
  - `url` (required): string. uniRPC paymaster endpoint, e.g. https://unirpc.uniswap.org/paymaster/v1/<chainId>
  - `context` (required): object. EIP-7677 paymasterService.context bundle. The wallet forwards this verbatim to the paymaster RPC (or — for ERC-4337 — to /wallet/encode_4337). `sponsorship` is opaque AES-256-GCM ciphertext whose integrity is enforced cryptographically on the uniRPC side
    - `sponsorship` (required): string
