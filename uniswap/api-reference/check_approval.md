# Check swap approvals

`POST https://trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1/check_approval`  
operationId: `check_approval` · tags: swapping

Allows the requestor to check if the `walletAddress` has the required approval to transact the `token` up to the `amount` specified. If the `walletAddress` does not have the required approval, the response will include a transaction to approve the token spend. If the `walletAddress` has the required approval, the response will return the approval with a `null` value. If the parameter `includeGasInfo` is set to `true` and an approval is needed, then the response will include both the transaction and the gas fee for the approval transaction.

Certain tokens may require that approval be reset before approving a new spend amount. If this condition is detected for the `walletAddress` and `token`, the response will include the necessary approval cancellation in the `cancel` paragraph. When `cancel` is not applicable, the paragraph will have a `null` value.

## Parameters

- `x-permit2-disabled` (header): Disables the Permit2 approval flow. When set to `true`, `permitData` is returned as `null` and the header is forwarded to the routing layer for correct gas simulation against the Proxy Universal Router contract. When `false` or omitted, the standard Permit2 approval flow is used. This header is intended for integrators whose infrastructure uses a direct approval-then-swap pattern without Permit2. default `False`

## Request body (application/json)

- `walletAddress` (required): string. The wallet address which will be used to send the token
- `token` (required): string. The token which will be sent, specified by its token address. For a list of supported tokens, see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)
- `amount` (required): string. The quantity of tokens denominated in the token's base units. (For example, for an ERC20 token one token is 1x10^18 base units. For one USDC token one token is 1x10^6 base units.) This value must be greater than 0
- `chainId` (required): number = `1`, `10`, `56`, `130`, `137`, `143`, `196`, `324`, `480`, `1868`, `4217`, `4326`, `4663`, `5042`, `8453`, `10143`, `42161`, `42220`, `43114`, `57073`, `59144`, `81457`, `7777777`, `1301`, `84532`, `11155111`. The unique ID of the blockchain. For a list of supported chains see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)
- `urgency`: object. The urgency impacts the estimated gas price of the transaction. The higher the urgency, the higher the gas price, and the faster the transaction is likely to be selected from the mempool. Send the bare string form (e.g. `"normal"`) for the common case, or the object form `{ level, overrides }` to supply caller caps for `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `maxFeePerGas`, and `gasLimit`
  - oneOf: `` string
    - enum: `normal`, `fast`, `urgent`
  - oneOf: `` object
    - `level` (required): string = `normal`, `fast`, `urgent`
    - `overrides`: object. Caller-supplied caps applied on top of the gas service's computed quote. All fields are absolute wei (decimal string). `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas` are treated as caps - they lower the quote, never raise it. `gasLimit`, if set, replaces the limit calculation entirely
      - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: string. Maximum priority fee in wei (decimal string)
      - `maxFeePerGas`: string. Maximum total fee per gas in wei (decimal string)
      - `gasLimit`: string. Gas limit cap (in gas units, decimal string)
- `includeGasInfo`: boolean. If set to `true`, the response will include the estimated gas fee for the proposed transaction
- `tokenOut`: string. The token which will be received, specified by its token address. For a list of supported tokens, see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)
- `tokenOutChainId`: number = `1`, `10`, `56`, `130`, `137`, `143`, `196`, `324`, `480`, `1868`, `4217`, `4326`, `4663`, `5042`, `8453`, `10143`, `42161`, `42220`, `43114`, `57073`, `59144`, `81457`, `7777777`, `1301`, `84532`, `11155111`. The unique ID of the blockchain. For a list of supported chains see the [FAQ](https://api-docs.uniswap.org/guides/faqs)
